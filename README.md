# 4chan Sounds Player

A floating player for 4chan sounds threads.

If you have [4chan External Sounds](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/31045-4chan-external-sounds) installed make you sure disable the inline player of this script under Settings > Playback.

## Sound Player UI

A link to open the player is shown at the top and bottom of the page, next to settings.

For 4chan X the link is in the header.

#### Display Modes

The playlist view lists all the sounds in the thread. You can drag items to adjust the play order. There are two [themes](#themes) that come with the player for modifying the playlist display.

The default playlist.

![Default Playlist UI](./images/playlist-default.png)

The fixed playlist fixes the playlist to the right of the page at full height. With this theme every but the playlist is hidden, with the header showing if you hover over the top. You can expand the playlist by dragging the left side of the header.

![Fixed Playlist UI](./images/playlist-fixed.png)

The playlist can be toggled by a button in the heading. With it hidden the image/video will fill the player.

![Image UI](./images/image-only-view.png)

You can opt to display a thumbnail in the bottom right of the page while the player is hidden. The example here shows a rather large image but the size is customisable. If you have 4chan X you can also have the sound controls be displayed in header.

#### Inline Player

The inline player can be set to play sounds when images are expanded, or full images are shown when hovering over thumbnails. If you have [4chan External Sounds](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/31045-4chan-external-sounds/code) installed you'll want to disable this under Settings > Playback.

#### Position/Resizing

The player can be moved by dragging the header and resized by dragging each corner.

#### Adding Local Files

To add local files (images with `[sound=<url>]` filenames) you can either click the + button in the header and select the files you want or drag and drop files onto the player.

If you want to test out a sound before you post it this is a good method of doing so.

## Creating Sound Images

A sound is set on an image by adding `[sound=<url>]` to the filename, where url is a link to the audio file. You can add as many sounds in this format as the filename length permits. The url needs to encoded so it's valid as part of a filename.

To create images using the sound player go to the tools view. The form here allows you to select/drop an image and sound. The sound will be uploaded to the selected host and the image will be renamed to include a a link to it. You can also select multiple sounds to add to a single image, but keep in mind the filename length limit when doing so. Once complete you can choose to post the created image, download it, or add it to the player. There are a few default hosts, but you can set up whatever hosts you want under Settings>Hosts. If you have a user token for the default hosts you can also set that there. Be aware that the default host filters only include default upload hosts.

## Sound Threads Search

The threads views allows you to search for threads that include a sound in the OP. You can select which boards to search and a search term to filter by.

The threads can be displayed in a table or a pseudo-board.

## Themes

There are two theme provided by default. The floating player, and a fixed playlist. By using templates and custom CSS you can create your own saved themes, and set keybinds to switch between.

#### Creating Themes

Certain sections of the UI allow you to provide custom HTML templates. In doing so the replacements below will be made to the provided template.

For the templates other than the row template, values that refer to a sound reference whichever is currently playing (or paused). So `p:{}` in the footer template will show the content if any sound is selected, whereas `p:{}` in the row template will show the content for only the row that is currently playing.


__Conditional Display__
- `p:{ <content> }` - Only displays the given content if the sound is currently selected.
- `h:{ <content> }` - Only displays the given content if the cursor is hovering over the element (i.e. the footer or row). Note that unlike `p:{}` that fully omits the contents this will instead wrap it in a containing div. If that messes up your template you can set a class of `fcsp-hover-display` on elements to achieve the same effect instead.

For both `p:{}` and `h:{}` the content given will have the same replacements applied. So, for example, you can choose to only show the menu button when hovering over a row by adding `h:{ menubutton }` to the row template.

__Sound Properties__
- `sound-count` - The number of songs added to the player.
- `sound-index` - The index of the sound (starting from 1).
- `sound-title` - The name of the sound. If you want to scroll long sound names use `sound-title-marquee`.

- `image` - Full image/webm/mp4 URL.
- `thumb` - Thumnail URL.
- `filename` - The entire filename, including `[sound=...]`.
- `imageMD5` - MD5 of the image.

__Config Properties__
The format for any config property is `$config[property]`. You can reference any config value but mainly the only useful ones are colors.

## API

The player can be controlled by using PlayerEvents with an action and arguments. The documentation below is as if you were calling the functions directly, but you'll need to send events as below.

`document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('PlayerEvent', { detail: { action: '<function name>', arguments: ...<args> } }))`

#### Playback
- `play()` - Play audio.
- `pause()` - Pause audio.
- `togglePlay()` - Play/pause the audio.
- `next({ group: Boolean, force: Boolean })` - Skip to the next sound. Pass `group: true` to the next sound image, and `force: true` to ignore repeat one being set.
- `previous({ group: false, force: false })` - Skip to the previous sound. Same arguments as `next`.
- `stop()` - Stop playback and close (not hide) the player.
- `volumeUp()` - Raise the volume by 5 percent.
- `volumeDown()` - Lower the volume by 5 percent.
- `toggleMute()` - Mute/unmute.
- `show()` - Display the player.
- `hide()` - Minimise the player.
- `playlist.search(value)` - Show search results for the given value in the playlist.
- `theme.switch(name)` - Switch theme.
- `theme.next()` - Switch to the next theme, according to the configured order.
- `theme.previous()` - Switch to the previous theme, according to the configured order.
- `set(property, value, { bypassValidation } )` - Set a config value. If `bypassValidation` is not set the value will be checked for changes and ignored if it's the same.
- `settings.export()` - Trigger an export of the user settings.
- `settings.import()` - Trigger a file input to import user settings.
- `settings.load(settings, { applyDefault: false })` - Load a user settings object. If `applyDefault` is set any settings not included in the given object will be set to the default. Otherwise they are left unchanged.
